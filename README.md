# ftp-server-client
FTP client server is a project created during the Fullstack Bootcamp from CodeforAll.

This project implements a simple File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client-server application using Java sockets. The application allows users to upload and download files between the client and server. It supports commands such as listing files, creating directories, and displaying available commands. The client-server communication is based on text-based messages.
